## Description
The Horiseon webpage looked nice and had a proper layout, however, the html and CSS files used a lot of elements that were not semantic. This makes the page inaccessible, especially when it comes to indivdiuals who want to use a screenreader to browse through the webpage.

I had already accidentally updated the images with the alts earlier on. I updated the webpage to Horiseon and then added the header tag as well as the nav tag in the header, replacing the div tag.

I updated the section with the main content by replacing the div tag with the aritcle tag as the parent tag. Then I labeled the child tags as section instead of div.

## Installation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.
